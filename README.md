All of my projects from my first semester of my first year @ UT <br><br>
Files coded up by me will have a comment saying so on the top of the file. Most projects include additional files for demonstration of functionality. Files not coded up by me were provided by Professor Mike Scott of UT's Computer Science department. All other credit is mentioned within the files.
